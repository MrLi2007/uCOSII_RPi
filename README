---------------------Porting uCOSII to the raspberry pi A+/B+/2B-----------------

Configure your toolchain in makefile:
1) for x86_64 host
ARMGNU ?= ./tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf
2) for x86 host
ARMGNU ?= ./tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf

To build, just type:
make

For RPi Model A+/B+
Copy the kernel.img to the first partition (BOOT,FAT32) of the SD card.

For RPi2 Model B
Copy the kernel7.img to the first partition (BOOT,FAT32) of the SD card.

User application in the usrApp folder, it used the bare-metal gpio implement.

Turn on the board, and then you will see UART message (in userAppx) and the ACT LED blink.
